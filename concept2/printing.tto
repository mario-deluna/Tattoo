// outputing data elements might be a bit 
// confusing at first.

// the print command plays a big role but is not
// always written down.

// so for example this:
h1 => 'Hello World'

// does exactly the same as:
add h1 => 'Hello World'

// if you don't wish to direclty print 
// you can store the expression inside a var
@helloWorld = h1 => 'Hello World'

// now that autoprinting stuff only works 
// when a new tag / element is defined
// following code won't do anything:
@helloWorld

// only by adding print the contents of that var 
// will be outputed
add @helloWorld

// experimental text blocks
